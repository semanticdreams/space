;; --- Helper for portable path normalization ---
;; Used by the module's internal file-path-basename and path-contains? helpers.
;; These tests verify the module handles Windows-style backslash paths correctly
;; when both forward-slash and backslash path separators are in play.
;; The module itself is expected to normalize internally; these tests exercise
;; the exported rule.run functions with backslash paths to prove the fix.
