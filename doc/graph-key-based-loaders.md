# Graph Key-Based Node Loaders

## Overview

A general-purpose system where any node type can register key-based loaders. When a node key is referenced but the node isn't in the graph, the appropriate loader can create and add it.

## Motivation

Currently, when code references a node by key (e.g., `graph:lookup(key)`), it only returns nodes that are already in the graph. This is a problem for features that store node key references persistently:

- **ListEntityNode** stores item keys in its entity data. When displaying items, `add-item-nodes` calls `graph:lookup` for each item key, but nodes that aren't in the graph are silently ignored.
- **LinkEntity** edges reference source/target keys. If those nodes aren't loaded, the edge can't be created.

With key-based loaders, these features can load nodes on-demand from their keys.

## Design

### Scheme-Based Matching

Loaders register a string **scheme**. When `load-by-key` is called:

- If the key contains `:`, the scheme is the substring before the first `:`.
- Otherwise, the entire key is treated as the scheme.

The graph then looks up a loader by exact scheme match.

Examples:
- Scheme `"string-entity"` matches keys like `"string-entity:abc-123-def"`
- Scheme `"list-entity"` matches keys like `"list-entity:xyz-456"`
- Scheme `"fs"` matches keys like `"fs:/home/user/documents"`
- Scheme `"hackernews-story-list"` matches keys like `"hackernews-story-list:newstories"`

The payload portion may contain additional `:` characters; only the first colon separates scheme from payload (e.g. `"fs:/tmp/a:b:c"` still has scheme `"fs"`).

### Explicit Invocation

Loading is explicit via `graph:load-by-key(key)`. The existing `graph:lookup(key)` is unchanged and only returns existing nodes. This keeps the system predictable - nodes are only created when explicitly requested.

### Node-Owned Registration

Node modules can register their own loaders, but the app also provides a centralized registry for built-in node types (`assets/lua/graph/key-loaders.fnl`) so graph creation can register everything in one place.

In practice, schemes should be treated as stable identifiers. This repo uses schemes that match the node type/module name (e.g. `hackernews-story`, `llm-message`, `string-entity`) so it’s easy to find the implementation and avoid drift.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Update Entity Node Key Formats

Entity-backed nodes must use `"<scheme>:<id>"` keys so scheme matching works.

**`assets/lua/graph/nodes/string-entity.fnl`**:
```fennel
;; Before
(local node (GraphNode {:key entity-id ...}))

;; After
(local node (GraphNode {:key (.. "string-entity:" entity-id) ...}))
```

Same pattern for:
- `list-entity.fnl` → `"list-entity:" .. entity-id`
- `link-entity.fnl` → `"link-entity:" .. entity-id`

### Step 2: Add Key Loader Registry to Graph

**`assets/lua/graph/core.fnl`**:

```fennel
;; After existing declarations in create-graph
(local key-loaders {})

(fn key-scheme [key]
  (when (and key (= (type key) "string"))
    (local (start _end) (string.find key ":" 1 true))
    (if start
        (string.sub key 1 (- start 1))
        key)))

(fn register-key-loader [_self scheme loader-fn]
  (assert scheme "register-key-loader requires a scheme")
  (assert (not (string.find scheme ":" 1 true))
          "register-key-loader scheme must not include ':'")
  (assert loader-fn "register-key-loader requires a loader function")
  (assert (not (. key-loaders scheme))
          (.. "register-key-loader duplicate scheme: " scheme))
  (set (. key-loaders scheme) loader-fn))

(fn load-by-key [_self key]
  (when (not key)
    (lua "return nil"))
  (assert (= (type key) "string") "load-by-key requires string key")
  ;; Return existing node if already in graph
  (local existing (. nodes key))
  (when existing
    (lua "return existing"))
  ;; Find loader and create node
  (local scheme (key-scheme key))
  (local loader (. key-loaders scheme))
  (when (not loader)
    (lua "return nil"))
  (local node (loader key))
  (when node
    (assert (. node :key) "load-by-key loader must return node with key")
    (assert (= (. node :key) key)
            (.. "load-by-key loader returned mismatched key: expected " key
                " got " (tostring (. node :key))))
    (self:add-node node))
  node)

;; Add to self table
(set self.register-key-loader register-key-loader)
(set self.load-by-key load-by-key)
```

### Step 3: Add Loader Registration to Node Modules

Each node type that supports key-based loading exports a `register-loader` function.

**`assets/lua/graph/nodes/string-entity.fnl`**:
```fennel
(local SCHEME "string-entity")
(local KEY_PREFIX (.. SCHEME ":"))

(fn extract-entity-id [key]
  (string.sub key (+ 1 (string.len KEY_PREFIX))))

(fn register-loader [graph opts]
  (local options (or opts {}))
  (local store (or options.store (StringEntityStore.get-default)))
  (graph:register-key-loader SCHEME
    (fn [key]
      (local entity-id (extract-entity-id key))
      (local entity (store:get-entity entity-id))
      (when entity
        (StringEntityNode {:entity-id entity-id :store store})))))

{:StringEntityNode StringEntityNode
 :register-loader register-loader}
```

Same pattern for `list-entity.fnl` and `link-entity.fnl`.

### Step 4: Register Loaders on Graph Creation

**`assets/lua/main.fnl`**:

After graph creation, register built-in loaders:

```fennel
(local GraphKeyLoaders (require :graph/key-loaders))

;; After: (set app.graph (Graph {}))
(GraphKeyLoaders.register app.graph)
```

### Step 5: Update ListEntityNode to Use load-by-key

**`assets/lua/graph/nodes/list-entity.fnl`**:

In `add-item-nodes`, change from lookup to load-by-key:

```fennel
;; Before
(each [_ item-key (ipairs items)]
  (local target (graph:lookup item-key))
  (when target
    ;; create edge...

;; After
(each [_ item-key (ipairs items)]
  (local target (graph:load-by-key item-key))
  (when target
    ;; create edge...
```

## API Reference

### graph:register-key-loader(scheme, loader-fn)

Register a loader function for keys matching the given scheme.

**Parameters:**
- `scheme` (string): The key scheme to match (e.g., `"string-entity"`)
- `loader-fn` (function): A function that takes a key and returns a node (or nil)

**Loader function signature:**
```fennel
(fn [key] -> node-or-nil)
```

The loader should:
1. Decide whether the key has a payload (`"<scheme>:<payload>"`) or is a bare key (`"<scheme>"`)
2. For payload keys, extract and validate the payload string
3. Check if the underlying data exists (e.g., entity in store)
4. Return a new node instance, or nil if the key is unsupported or data doesn't exist

### graph:load-by-key(key)

Load or lookup a node by its key.

**Parameters:**
- `key` (string): The node key to load

**Returns:**
- The existing node if already in the graph
- A newly created and added node if a loader matches
- `nil` if no node exists and no loader matches (or loader returns nil)

## Extending to Other Node Types

Any node type can add key-based loading by:

1. Using a `"<scheme>:<payload>"` key format (or a bare key for singleton nodes)
2. Exporting a `register-loader` function
3. Registering the loader after graph creation

Example for a hypothetical `BookmarkNode`:

```fennel
(local SCHEME "bookmark")
(local KEY_PREFIX (.. SCHEME ":"))

(fn BookmarkNode [opts]
  (local url (assert opts.url "BookmarkNode requires url"))
  (GraphNode {:key (.. KEY_PREFIX url)
              :label (or opts.title url)
              :view BookmarkNodeView
              ...}))

(fn register-loader [graph opts]
  (local bookmarks-db (or opts.db (get-default-db)))
  (graph:register-key-loader SCHEME
    (fn [key]
      (local url (string.sub key (+ 1 (string.len KEY_PREFIX))))
      (local bookmark (bookmarks-db:get url))
      (when bookmark
        (BookmarkNode {:url url :title bookmark.title})))))

{:BookmarkNode BookmarkNode
 :register-loader register-loader}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Add `assets/lua/tests/test-graph-loaders.fnl`:

1. **Loader registration**: Verify loaders are stored by scheme
2. **load-by-key existing node**: Returns existing node without calling loader
3. **load-by-key loadable key**: Calls loader, adds node, returns it
4. **load-by-key unknown key**: Returns nil when no loader matches
5. **load-by-key loader returns nil**: Returns nil when entity doesn't exist
6. **Scheme parsing**: Verify scheme-before-first-colon and bare-key scheme behavior
7. **Safety**: Duplicate scheme registration and loader key mismatch assertions

### Integration Tests

1. Create a string entity
2. Create a list entity and add the string entity's key to its items
3. Without loading the string entity node, call `graph:load-by-key` with its key
4. Verify the node is created and added to the graph

### Manual Testing

1. Create a string entity from the entities panel
2. Create a list entity
3. Add the string entity to the list
4. Close and reopen the app
5. Open the list entity view
6. Verify the string entity item is displayed (previously would be ignored)

## Migration Notes

Changing key formats from `entity-id` to `"<scheme>:" + entity-id` is a breaking change for existing persisted data. Affected stores:

- **ListEntityStore**: Items array contains node keys
- **LinkEntityStore**: source-key and target-key fields
- **Position persistence**: Node positions stored by key

Existing data with old-format keys will not match the new scheme-based keys. This is acceptable per design decision - old data won't load until manually migrated.
